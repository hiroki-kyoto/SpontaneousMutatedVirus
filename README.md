SpontaneousMutatedVirus
=======================

Pure C code -- realize a spontaneous mutated computer program, which can change its own source code and compile it under certain environment, and generate descendants of its own, which behave differently, and it's sort of like a biological virus, which have genetic mutation and generate new descendants and keep herself alive until she finished her reproduction job.And her descendants can do the same job, plus doing something different tasks when alive.
